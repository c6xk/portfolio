So, I think I'm done here for now, I hate writing texts and creating texts with some very deep thought, however I always had the need to show you something, to demonstrate what I feel. I always talk about you to my friends, I don't speak ill of you, in fact I always talk about how much I like you and how you are something very special to me, I talk a lot about you to help me reason about you, because in relation to baby i'm too weak, i have no control over it and it's bizarre.

Your attitudes are confusing as hell, I never know what you're feeling or not feeling, as much as you've said some great things I still don't know for the simple fact that you just disappear without explaining anything to me and leave me, me leave with feelings that corrode me inside. Sometimes people say to have the benefit of the doubt, but the doubt in my head is something I avoid as much as possible, I always look for the answers to everything, I always want to know more, just knowing that you're alive somewhere doesn't bother me. it's enough so I want to be able to be by your side at all times trying to always give you everything I can, I want to be able to see you smile like I saw your smile in a twitch video, that gave me one of the biggest motivations to give everything me all the time and give up everything that doesn't bring me closer to you.

Think of something that you've been inspired by, think about how much you want it and think that this is someone, you wouldn't want to see that person go through anything bad again in your life and you would try to ease the pain as much as possible, I not only want to be able to give all of me, I want to be able to help you give your all to achieve what you want.
Well, I think that's all I have to say for now, because that's what I can do for now. It's all luv.
